## Hi there
I'm famfo, or Thilo. I do some stuff, like coding stuff in Rust ðŸ¦€. I also am a giant Linux nerd.<br>
I manage to somehow write bad issues on some repos.<br>
<br>
Most of my projects are on a friends [gitea](https://git.karx.xyz/famfo).

### Some interesting stuff I worked 
- [async-circe](https://docs.rs/async-circe/latest/async_circe/) - an async IRC crate written in Rust.
- [frogfetch](https://github.com/famfo/frogfetch-rs) - get some information about your system, but frogged.
- One project of a small operating system in Rust, which sadly was abandoned.

<hr>
  
Fun fact: developing on and for Windows in Rust is annoying and I hate it.
